Hi. I'm Justin Edelson. I write code, write about code, helped other people write code, talked about code, seen a million faces, etc. Now I'm an Experience Architect and Evangelist for the Adobe Marketing Cloud focused specifically on Adobe Experience Manager. Which is the best job in the world as far I'm concerned. I get to work with a great people and great products.
