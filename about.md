Hi. I'm Justin Edelson.

I've done a lot of things in the last 20 years -- wrote code, wrote about code, helped other people write code, talked about code, seen a million faces, etc. Now I'm the Global Evangelist for Adobe Experience Manager. Which is the greatest job in the world. I get to work with a great people and a great product.
